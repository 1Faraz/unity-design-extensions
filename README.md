# Unity Design Extensions (UDE)
Every developer is a work juggling multitasker, it's always the case, but should it have to be?
Enhancing the developer's experience, *UDE* eliminate the distractions and centralize your focus on the priorities. Focus on what you actually want to do, leaving the tedious, time-consuming bits to us.

## Overview

### What does this repository contain?
#### State Model Framework 
Provides a clear workflow for your project which puts you in control over scalability, makes it easy for you to expand and debug your project.

#### Menu System *`[in progress]`*
Enables you to easily navigate through your menu pages/popups with transitions and animation (using unity's state machine) of your choice without writing any code.

#### Event System
Allows you to assign events during runtime via reflection it's fast and well optimized for **all platforms** including mobile platforms. Can also support multiple parameters compared with the unity event system with single parameters.

## What's next?
State Model Framework combined with the Event System allows you to create generic components which makes it reusable in other projects, regardless of its classification. Therefore, we encourage you all to share your work in the community so that others can benefit from. Check out our [community page](https://bitbucket.org/pepupstudios/community-components/src/master/).

We would love to see what you guys can create!
